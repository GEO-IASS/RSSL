#R Semi-Supervised Learning package
This R package provides implementations of several semi-supervised learning methods, in particular, our of own work involving constraint based semi-supervised learning. 

The package is still under development. Therefore, function names and interfaces are still subject to change.

#Installation Instructions
This package is not yet available on CRAN. To install the latest version of the package using the devtools package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("jkrijthe/RSSL")
```

#Usage
After installation, load the package as usual:
```
library(RSSL)
```
The following code generates a simple dataset, trains a supervised and two semi-supervised classifiers and evaluates their performance:
```
# Generate dataset
df <- generate2ClassGaussian(d=2,expected=TRUE)
df_lab <- df[sample(nrow(df),10),]
df_unlab <- df[sample(nrow(df),1000),]
df_unlab$Class <- NA
df_combined <- rbind(df_lab, df_unlab)

# Train Classifiers
t_sup <- LeastSquaresClassifier(Class~., df_lab)
t_self <- SelfLearning(Class~., df_combined, method=LeastSquaresClassifier)
t_ic <- ICLeastSquaresClassifier(Class~., df_combined)

# Evaluate performance: Squared Loss & Error Rate
mean(loss(t_sup,df))
mean(loss(t_self,df))
mean(loss(t_ic,df))

mean(predict(t_sup,df)!=df$Class)
mean(predict(t_self,df)!=df$Class)
mean(predict(t_ic,df)!=df$Class)
```
For an overview of different classifiers and examples on how to use them, see the [classifier overview vignette][https://cdn.rawgit.com/jkrijthe/RSSL/master/vignettes/SSL-Classifiers.html].
